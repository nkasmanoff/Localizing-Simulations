Work needed:
0) This modeling can be done with GEANT (items 1-4).
   (Items 5-6 are done with localization s/w.)

1) Effective area vs theta,phi coordinates around a single GTM detector module.
   (This theta,phi coordinates is centered on the module)
1a) Do this for several energies.  (values TBD)

2) Do this for a "bare" detector module (ie no other mass around it).

3) Do this for a few simple/generic cases of large passive material objects located
   nearby a detector module.
   Objects of concern are:
       An XRT and IRT telescope tube  (use a solid cylinder of "matter foam"),
       Sunshade wall   (use a square plate of material X of density Y),
       Instrument Deck plate   (use a circular plate of material X of density Y),
   a) Use cylinder made of aluminum(?) "foam"
   b) place the cylinder in the sysmetric location wrt the GTM module,  and
   c) place the cylinder in the off-to-the-side (asysmetric) location wrt the GTM module.

4) Do this with a graded-Z sheild added just behind the conical section of the PMT housing.
   (This addresses a concern raised by the Fermi people that enough photons
    come in through "back hemisphere of module's response tht is distorts
    the final position by a significant amount.  So a graded-Z shield is simple
    and it might reduce the problem.)

5) Choose some different geometries of detectors modules:
   a) How mnay modules?  At least 6-8; how many more (12?).
      We need to cover that "back end" of the observatory
      when the Observatory is looking at a point near the Earth horizon.
   b) What is the pattern of boresights on the 4pi sphere?


6) With these few EffArea vs theta,phi,energy matrices,  they will be run through
the burst-location calculation software.  To see what these local-masses
do to the "ideal" burst locations, ie how many degress is the location moved?
